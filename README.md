# CodeItChallenge
Workspace for my old school's coding competition, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
# Scenario
A casino committee made a survey asking their clients which games they would be interested in playing. The most popular request was a lottery style game.

The casino committee is looking for a lottery game in which they can invest in.
Your task is therefore to create a lottery game which follows the classic choose 5 numbers from 50 (Does not have to be 5 out of 50, you decide), and if you get the 5 numbers correct you win a prize.

The more detailed your lottery game, the more the committee is likely to invest in you. So remember to add any features you think will improve your code. Hard work and creativity will pay off!

Remember to prepare a pitch to sell your lottery to the committee.
